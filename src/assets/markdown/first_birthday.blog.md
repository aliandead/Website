And so... What's next??? Well! Let's talk about my plan for Alian/DEAD in the near future.

# A NEW PROJECT INCOMING
**Veiture** is my most recent long-term project. I initially came up with the idea in summer 2022 but ended up officially working on it a year later. I'm not planning on revealing too much about it this year either, yet looking closely may help you to read between<a class="no-underline" href="https://instagram.com/aliandead">&#8201;</a>the lines.
But if you are eager to know: Codenamed, **Veiture** is an anime style action role-playing game. It will be developed with its very own engine.

Now you might be wondering why create an engine from scratch? As an independant developer, I develop my projects by myself from start to finish. Unless I want to spend weeks or months on something, I may use libraries from third parties to get things done more quickly.

Let's say I choose an existing engine to develop my game, I would have to learn about that specific engine and its way of dealing with the creation of a game. Whereas making my own engine, will allow me to learn about the inner workings resulting in a better understanding of all game engines in general.

Stay tuned for more information to be unveiled next year!

# WHAT ABOUT MY OTHER PROJECTS?
Some of my projects such as **ReNote** or **French.NET** are still being developed even though I often lack of time. In case you are not familiar with my current projects, **ReNote** is a timetable software designed to boost your productivity as a student or teacher. **French.NET** on the other hand is an implementation of the French language in C#. It will have the ability to generate sentences and correct sentences with 100% accuracy.
