# NightTools - February 2020
NightTools is the first application I ever made. It was written in VB.NET.

The goal was to create an interface where you could easily access "useful" utilities. I'm not going to lie: it turned out to be terrible. It had nothing out of the ordinary and every feature I implemented was a shortcut away. So it was just useless. And the UI wasn't that good either.

Uh, I already regret showing this but whatever, it's part of my journey. But wait! Did I mention that you have to wait 30 seconds to use the app.

Yep, this loading screen is more pointless than the app itself. Oh and I was in my minecraft phase, that's why there is a minecraft logo and background. (Why did I even do that?) 

But at that point, can it get even worse? Spoiler: Yes, it can.

I added a music of some random game into the app as well. Why? I don't know. Thankfully you can turn it off via the menu above when right clicking.

It doesn't end here. According to my past self, you obviously needed three versions of the same software with almost the same features.

Why there's a galaxy that fills 75% of the window? I don't know either. In fact, I absolutely don't know what I was thinking of when coding that app.

Nonetheless, it's not that bad for a beginner I'd say. It helped me to get along with programming languages. I'll give it a 3/10.
