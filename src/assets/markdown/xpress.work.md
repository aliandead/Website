# Xpress Studio - February 2021
This time, we are talking about IDEs. (Integrated Development Environments) Such software allow developers to have a better experience when writing code. For instance, instead of writing everything letter by letter, the "Auto Completion" feature allows you to finish the keyword or variable you are trying to type by hitting the TAB key. I was mostly inspired by Visual Studio for this project as it's the one I've always used.

Let's get started with the always so useless splash screen. Inspired by Windows 7.

</p>

Moving on to the empty window with the Visual Studio 2010 icon, somehow. 

Fun fact: the first IDE I used when I really got into programming was Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express because I just didn't have enough disk space to install Visual Studio 2019.

Seems like you could even register an unfinished product! I'm loving the "Please enter **the your** product key." That's some English skills right there.

I mean at least I added a new project dialog. Why there is a "RedButton1"? I don't know. And to spice things up a bit, every time you open the window, it duplicates the "Root Templates." But the real question is: does it work?

The answer is yes. (sort of) When you click "ok" it doesn't close to the window or anything. But hold on, it does something:

</p>

Look at this beautiful project that can't even be opened using Visual Studio because I didn't add anything in the project file. But don't worry I'm not finished! I didn't finish *THIS* project but what if I told you that I tried multiple times? This one will work? Right?

</p>

Look at this! It actually works and creates a project. Can I run the code though?

</p>

Well no. But except from the word "compilation" being written incorrectly, the only reason it doesn't work is because I hardcoded the output executable to "F:\MyApp.exe" so now I have to plug two USB keys to make it work.

I noticed that the Module doesn't have a name in the code, I added one and boom look at that.

It seems to be the only working one out of the many I created. The one below is likely my last attempt:

</p>

If I remember correctly, I wanted to mix Visual Studio 2017 UI with Microsoft Edge Vertical tabs. Something like that.

The lack of knowledge I had during that time is likely the main reason I didn't successfully finish this project. A 5/10 because I made one that work.
