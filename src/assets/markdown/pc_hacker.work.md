# PC Hacker - December 2020
PC Hacker. I mean you can call it NightTools V2. It's basically the sequel to the first movie. Okay so is it better now? Well maybe. We always improve overtime after all. We just have to keep trying and trying. But, here it doesn't really seem to change the fact that the app is still completely pointless.

Sure the UI isn't that bad.

Except for the fact that you can't even tell what button does what. Like what does the "triangle on top of the square and circle" do? Jokes aside, those details can always be modified but I just want to point out the fact that I wasn't asking myself the right questions when doing something. If we take the project as a whole, I don't think I correctly defined what I really wanted to do.

I mean take the "Virtual App" feature. You can't get higher in level of pointless. The only thing that it does is try to launch apps as a child window.

There are only two apps you could launch: notepad and wordpad. Can you tell me who needs to run notepad in a parent window? I mean sure at that time, notepad didn't have tabs. But still.

The funniest thing is that it doesn't even work anymore. In Windows 11 at least. Both apps just launch outside the window, so it doesn't do anything anymore.

In a few months, I greatly improved my UIs. But it doesn't change the fact that the app is almost useless. That's a 4/10.
