What's new? (December Update 1)

# CAUGHT SUM BUGS
Had one major issue with the particles; they weren't sticking to the viewport which caused them to go out of bounds when the page was scrolled. 

It was somewhat easy to fix, I just had to change one line (Most of the times it takes more time to actually find the issue than actually fixing it). But now that's out of the way, you'll be able to enjoy the particles everywhere! 

# MINOR CHANGES
Here are some minor changes I've made to the website:
 - New background (<u>Highway At Night</u> by Billy Woodford)
 - Particles are now falling down instead of going up
 - Some texts have now lighter colors
