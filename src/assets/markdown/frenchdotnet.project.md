# French.NET - May 2023
(Yes, I know I haven't made a logo for it yet)

You can call me crazy on this one, I won't mind. French.NET has two main features: Generate sentences and verify sentences.

Not only you'll be able to generate sentences that are perfect, but you'll also be able to check if a sentence has a grammatical issue and/or if a word is orthographically incorrect.

French.NET works using scripts. Each script represents a rule of the French language.
