# Veiture - July 2022
I got the idea of an anime action role-playing game in summer of 2022. The idea stayed in mind for about 6 months. Until I started writing down what I had in mind in January 2023. It was just the beginning of a potential scenario. I left it still until Summer 2023.

I tried to write a different story. But I wasn't satifisfied with it so I decided to use what I wrote early this year.

In August, I decided to ask the help of one of my friend. He's not a developer but still has some knowledge in computer science. He also has some great skills in drawing. After coming back from vacation I quickly started working on the engine. Because yes, I'm going to make an engine specifically for this game. A game completely from scratch in C++. It seems insane and it probably is. But in reality, it's just a big project. I don't think it's difficult, it simply involves a lot of knowledge and time. I believe that all the times I failed greatly helped me. This time is the time!

I can tell that 2024 is going to be epic.
