# Crysmon - January 2023
When I started working on DotEngine, I planned on creating a game platform for it. It was called "DotGame." But after the transition from C# to C++, I decided to split the project. That's how Crysmon was born.

But DotEngine must be finished before I start working on Crysmon.
