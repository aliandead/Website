# ALSD Office - January 2021
ALSD Office (shortened version of "AL Studio Dev Office") is a suite of office softwares for Windows. I haven't really worked on it that much. To be more precise I spent more time working on useless stuff like the setup than the actual software. If I remember correctly it's simply because I was looking inside the ISO of Microsoft Office. And it got me into trying to make one.

First, someone must explain why I put a Windows 7 logo as icon. Secondly, you may (or not) recognize the background color which is the same one as the Windows 8 (through 11) setup. The "Install Now" button doesn't do anything. (just so you know)

This app was simply an idea. In the end, I haven't really worked on anything. That's a 2/10.
