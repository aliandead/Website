# Minecraft Launcher - April 2021
This time you'll be satisfied to know that I finished this project. Does it still work now? Well, of course!

Why "Youtube Minecraft Launcher"? I was actually planning on making a tutorial but I simply never had the time to do it.

Although, it's not really the first minecraft launcher I made. Someone needed a minecraft launcher for their server and I really wanted to try and make one.

In my opinion, it looks pretty cool for a first time. But it isn't as pretty when you look at the code.

I'll give it a 7/10 because it just works and the server owner liked it.
