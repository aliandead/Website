What's new? (December Update 2)

# MAJOR CHANGES

## PROJECT DISCOVERY
The "Projects" page has been completely revamped, there are now two sections: "Current projects" and "Previous works / ideas" You can now discover some of my past works and current projects. And If you want to know, I'm absolutely roasting myself when talking about my past works.

## ABOUT PAGE
New resume which includes my formations and skills in the "About" page!
