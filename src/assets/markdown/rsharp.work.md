# RuntimeSharp - October 2021
Originally made for DotEngine. It's a command-line utility used to run C# on the fly.

The way the tool works is mostly inspired by java. You have a .rcs file which is a package similar to jar files. You have to specify what C# file contain the main method. You can also import dlls and set extra arguments for the program.

You can question whether it's useful or not. But it does exactly what I wanted so I'll give it a 6/10.
